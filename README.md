# Movies-ETL Analysis

## Overview of Project
Britta needs my help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
  
### Purpose
I need to refactored the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Movies-ETL Analysis Results
Attached are the results of the attached function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

### Results
